# ML-Forest-Cover-Prediction

The Forest Cover Type Prediction is a supervised multi-class classification problem addressing the prediction of the forest cover type using cartographic features. The main goal of the project is to construct predictive models and then compare and evaluate their respective classification accuracies. The following are the tasks and goal associated with this project. The primary task would be to ensure the quality of the data via data cleansing. Post cleansing, dimensionality reduction (if required), feature Engineering, and correlation analysis using Pandas, sklearn packages would be used to build the model. K-fold approach would be used to train and test the model for different values of K and the metrics for each case would be recorded. The data set will be used to build classification models using various feasible algorithms like Naive Bayes, SVM, Random forests, K nearest neighbors, Decision trees and many more. The performance and evaluation of each algorithm will be recorded and visualized using matplotlib to graphically illustrate the qualitative and quantitative analyses performed as part of the project.
